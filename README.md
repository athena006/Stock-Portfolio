# Stock-Portfolio

Hi, this programme is a basic stock portfolio that links to an Excel file to get data of stocks and prices. I have used the pandas library to read from the excel file and may use matplotlib in the future to create graphical representations of the stocks.

As you update the data in the excel file and save it, this programme will update the stocks as well.
